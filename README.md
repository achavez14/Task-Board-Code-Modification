# Task-Board-Code-Modification

## Description
The Task Board application provides a graphical depiction of project tasks arranged into columns denoting the various stages of completion: “Not Yet Started,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.” Tasks are color-coded to indicate whether they are nearing the deadline (yellow) or overdue (red). Tasks can be added, updated and deleted by users, and localStorage is used to store persistent data.
